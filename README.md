# Freedom of speech is fundamental to a free society. 

## Censorship must not be tolerated, even when it suits one\'s ideology.  

## We helped create this issue; we must now join together to fix it.



#### The strategy is simple:

1. Catalog entities associated with censorship (left or right).
2. Stop using/supporting these entities when and where practical.
3. Discover and/or design uncensored, non-partisan, replacements.
4. Support non-technical friends and family in this transition.

### Known Entities Associated with Censorship:

- Google
- Facebook
- Reddit
- YouTube
- Instagram
- TODO

TODO: Every entity should include evidence (links) of censorship
TODO: Create list of alternative services, and works in progress
TODO: Links to websites against censorship (non-politically affiliated)


#### Note: This is not a partisian effort. Contributions from all sides are welcome.

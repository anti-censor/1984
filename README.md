# Freedom of speech is fundamental to a free society. 

## Censorship must not be tolerated, even when it suits one\'s ideology.  

## We helped create this issue; we must now join together to fix it.



#### The strategy is simple:

1. Catalog entities associated with censorship (left or right).
2. Stop using/supporting these entities when and where practical.
3. Discover and/or design uncensored replacements.
4. Support non-technical friends and family in this transition.

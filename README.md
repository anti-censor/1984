# Freedom of speech is fundamental to a free society. 

## Censorship must not be tolerated, even when it suits one\'s ideology.  

## We helped create this issue; we must now join together to fix it.

#### This is not a partisan effort!
#### Alternatives can be partisan (besides news outlets), so long as they do not censor.
#### Contributions from all sides are welcome.
#### If you believe any of the above information to be incorrect, please create an issue.

<br>

#### The strategy is simple:

1. Catalog entities associated with censorship (left or right).
2. Stop using/supporting these entities when and where practical.
3. Leave poor reviews for these entities.
4. Discover and/or design uncensored replacements.
5. Support non-technical friends and family in this transition.
